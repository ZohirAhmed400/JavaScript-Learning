// diffrence between var, let & const
// var is a globle variable 
// let is a scope variable 
// const is a constant variable (not changeble)

let age = 35
const gravity = 9.81
let mass = 72
const PI = 3.14

// More Examples
const boilingPoint = 100
const bodyTemp = 37

console.log(age, gravity, mass, PI, boilingPoint, bodyTemp)
